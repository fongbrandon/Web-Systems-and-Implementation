<!--
    Hashing is a one-way encryption process such that a hash value cannot be reverse engineered
    to get to the original plain text. Hashing is used in encryption to secure the information 
    shared between two parties.

    A secret key in cryptography is a piece of information, usually a string of numbers or letters 
    that are stored in a file, which, when processed through a cryptographic algorithm, can encode 
    or decode cryptographic data.
